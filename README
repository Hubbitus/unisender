Unisender script to send SMS messages via http://unisender.com service.
	To use it you are must be registered user and have positive balance. Then you should take api_key
	what is required to perform any actions. You may provide it each time call this script via --key,
	alternatively you may place it in config file: ~/.config/unisender/config as API_KEY
